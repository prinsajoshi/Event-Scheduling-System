<h1>Event Scheduling System with Timezone and Overlap Validation </h1></br>
Objective: </br>
This project focuses on building an Event Scheduling System that allows users to create
and manage events while handling complexities such as timezone management, overlap
detection, and time-sensitive validations. The system will ensure that events are scheduled
properly without conflicts and that they respect the users' timezones.
